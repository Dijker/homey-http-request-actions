# Simple HTTP GET/PUT/POST Connector for flows

This app let you run HTTP requests from flows. Responses are ignored.

### Action cards:
- HTTP Delete
- HTTP Get
- HTTP Put JSON
- HTTP Post JSON

Passing of a valid JSON string (like at least {} ) is obligatory for GET en POST cards.  Happy hacking!

### Condition card:
- HTTP Get Response Code: Checks the HTTP response code of a GET Request.
